welcome! this is the code for the down app, currently available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/down-app/id1601300777).

it's built with expo using typescript and firebase. poke around the /app directory to find all the component and style code. poke around the /firebase directory to find all of the auth, functions, and firestore related code.

thanks for checking it out! :)
